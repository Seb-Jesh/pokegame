React Props: Pokedex

This exercise lets you practice using React Components and properties.

Create a Pokemon application (a Pokedex) that displays an interface that looks like this"

Part 1: Building Components

To create the pokedex, you should use 3 components:

App
This should just render a single Pokedex
(It is common for the top level app to not have direct logic in it, but to render the top application object - this
becomes useful when you build sites that compose several different parts together.)

Pokecard
Shows a single Pokemon, with their name, image, and type.

Pokedex
Is povided, via props, an array of objects describing different pokemon, and renders a series of Pokecard components.

Use the defaultProps feature of Pokecard to provide a default list of Pokemon characters to show. You can use this list
for a good set of defaults"

[
{id: 4, name: 'Charmander', type: 'fire', base_experience: 62},
{id: 7, name: 'Squirtle', type: 'water', base_experience: 63},
{id: 11, name: 'Metapod', type: 'bug', base_experience: 72},
{id: 12, name: 'Butterfree', type: 'flying', base_experience: 178},
{id: 25, name: 'Pikachu', type: 'electric', base_experience: 112},
{id: 39, name: 'Jigglypuff', type: 'normal', base_experience: 95},
{id: 94, name: 'Gengar', type: 'poison', base_experience: 225},
{id: 133, name: 'Eevee', type: 'normal', base_experience: 65}
]

For each pokemon, their image sourse should be:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/${id}.png

Further study

Fancier images
Use this alternate source for nicer looking images:
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/detail/${id}.png

Note that the pokemon id for these images must be padded with zeros to three places, like: 001, 002, 034, 199, etc. Try
writing a function to take an id like 4 and turn it into 004.

Pokegame Component
Modify your component hierarchy so that App renders a component called pokegame.
Pokegame should take your list of 8 pokemon and randomly assign them into two hands of 4 cards each. It should then render two pokedex components one for each hand.

Once you have got this working, modify your pokegame so that it also calculates the total experience for each hand
of pokemon. It should pass this total to the pokedex.

Next, have the pokegame component determine which hand is the "winner," where the winning hand is the one with the
higher total experience. Then modify the pokedex component one more time so that it accepts a prop of isWinner.
If the Pokedex is the winning one, it should display the message _THIS HAND WINS!_ at the bottom of the deck.

Now when you load the page, you should see two different hands with a randomly changing winner every time you referesh.

Styling
Add styling to your components - perhaps you can do interesting things when hovering over a Pokecard, or have them
smoothly transition into the page, all via css?

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
